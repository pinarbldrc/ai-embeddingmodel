This project is a Spring Boot–based AI-powered search and chatbot application that demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into backend systems to transform natural language user queries into structured, backend-ready search parameters, and to perform semantic search using vector embeddings (RAG).

The application focuses on real-world enterprise use cases, such as e-commerce product search, AI-assisted filtering, and retrieval-augmented generation.
